# Facial-key-point-detection-and-Emotion-recognition-An-application-of-Deep-neural-network.
Here in this project I have developed two models. First model is to detect the facial key points of a person’s face in an image. And the second model is an emotion recognition model able to recognize emotions such as ‘anger’, ‘surprise’, ‘disguise’, ‘happiness’ etc. Now I have used Residual Networks here to develop both the models because Residual networks give us very deep model and it helps to reduce the problem of ‘vanishing gradient descent’. Now this is called ‘Emotion AI’ as it recognizes emotions and the facial key points for that emotion.
